                          Dark Visions II

DV2 took three months to make, working on it off and on. We've worked
especially hard to bring you a quality game. Yet we will be hard pressed
to keep up our work in the future without any support. So if you like the 
game, please send:
        $8 to       Kreuzer Industries
                    72 Hale Road
                    Canton, NY 13617

For this donation you will receive the hint guide for Dark Visions II,
and if you wish to enclose an extra $2 for shipping & handling you will
receive The Dream Giver(with the hints), our previous VGA adventure 
game. If you order Dream Giver, you can also have the Dark Visions II 
Qbasic source code for free if you specify it. (Don't expect to understand
too much of it though.)
                      Thank you for playing
